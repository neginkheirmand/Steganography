# Steganography
this project was inspired by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWEXCYQKyDc&t=400s&ab_channel=Computerphile)

Hiding text inside images using steganography, without distorting the image too much.


### Content:
binLibrary.py -> text to binary array
changePhoto.py-> hide text inside specified image
decoder.py-> decoder
steganography-> run to see the magic happen :)
.\test\difference.py -> cant see any difference between the images? run this scrypt to mark the different pixels with red
